In this repository I built a web microservice that works with the entities of Product, User and Supplier, each one of them retrieves data with in a different way.

### 1 Step

Open the folder of the project with Visual Studio Code.

### 2 Step

Type on the integrated terminal of VSC "npm install" press enter and wait for NodeJs Package Manager to finish the installation

### 3 Step [if you wanna run the code]

Once the installation is done run the command "npm start" on the same terminal to build the application.

### 3 Step [if you wanna debug the code]

Once the installation is done run the command "npm start:db" on the same terminal to start the remote database server and press F5 to debug.

### 4 Step

If the step 3 finished successfully\* you should be able to enter in the web application client by clicking on the following link: http://localhost:3000.

##### \*if the application didn't build successfully

It's normal, go back to the terminal and press twice [CTRL + C] till you see printed "^C", then enter again the command "npm start" to rebuild the project and it will work.

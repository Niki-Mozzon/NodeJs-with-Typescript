# NodeJs-with-Typescript

In this repository I'm trying to approach to NodeJs through Typescript in order to have a cleaner and stricter code.

### 1 Step

This Repository has multiple projects: open the folder of the project you are interested with Visual Studio Code.

### 2 Step

Run on the integrated terminal of VSC the command "npm install" and wait for NodeJs Package Manager to finish the installation

### 3 Step

Once the installation it's done type "npm start" and press enter on the same terminal to build the application.

### 4 Step

If the application built successfully\* you should be able to enter in the web application client clicking on the following link: http://localhost:3000.

#

#

#

#

#

##### \*if the application didn't build successfully

It's normal, go back to the terminal and press twice [CTRL + C] till you see printed "^C", then enter again the command "npm start" to rebuild the project and it will work.
